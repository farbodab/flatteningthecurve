This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition: Workerswho have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available: A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Yourprimary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without firsthaving a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.  I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day inorder to protect your health. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstayat home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thankyou for all of your support. These are difficult times, but together wewill move through and protect the most vulnerable among us."""

In doing so, hospitals can preserve capacity as casesof COVID-19 continue to grow in Ontario. As hospitals move forward with the implementation of their pandemic plans and decisions ontheir operations, we are asking them to follow three guiding principles: Use an ethical framework to guide decision-making;Prevent high risk and occult transmission; and Develop and preserve capacity within our system. Theapproach that we are taking will provide the necessary discretion for hospitals to make decisions based on local circumstances, while preserving the ability for the province to take a more prescriptive approach, should it be warranted based on evidence.

On March 13, we announced measures to protectOntario's adult correctional facilities from COVID-19 by granting intermittent inmates, who serve time on the weekends, temporary absencesfrom custody, and temporarily halting personal visits. Intermittent inmates have already been deemed low-risk by the courts and remain in the community Monday to Friday to live and work. Building on these changes, Ontario is implementing amendments to Regulation 778 under the Ministry of Correctional Services Act toallow senior corrections officials to expand the use of temporary absences and for the Ontario Parole Board to use alternatives to in-person meetings. Going forward, correctional services will have the option to issue temporary absences beyond the current 72-hour maximum. This means those serving intermittent sentences, who have been granted a temporary absence will not have to report to a correctional facility every weekend, which will avoid cycling individuals back and forth between the community and a correctional facility.  In addition, the longer-term temporary absences will allow for early release of those inmates who are near the end of their sentence. To ensure public safety, inmates would be carefully assessed to ensure theyare a low risk to reoffend. Those inmates who have been convicted of serious crimes, such as violent crimes or crimes involving guns, would not be considered for early release. A second regulatory amendment will allow the Ontario Parole Board to conduct hearings by electronic or written means, rather than solely in-person, providing alternate options for hearings. We continue to evaluate all options to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 within our correctionalsystem. These regulatory amendments will help us preserve the integrityof our health care system, protect our frontline workers and help keep our communities safe."""

These enhanced measures will support the province's extensive efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. On March 23, Ontario enacted a new order under the March 17, 2020declaration of emergency to ensure personnel are properly deployed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to keep staff, volunteers and residents in long-term care homes safe. This temporary order would give long-term care homes the ability to free-up valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment plans. Under this temporary order long-term care homes will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as: Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the health service provider;Changingthe assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferringor cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining unit work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. Dr.David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has also issued a new directive for long-term care homes under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007that restricts residents from leaving a home for short visits with family and friends. In doing so, the province is ensuring residents do not inadvertently contract COVID-19 while out of the home and spread thevirus upon their return. Instead, residents who want to go outside willbe able to remain on the home's property and maintain safe social distancing from any family and friends who visit them. ""Ontario is implementing critical and necessary measures to ensure that we are able to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians, in particular our seniors,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We have been working for several months now, with all our partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and long-term care operators, to put processes in place to contain this virus and be ready to respond to any scenario."" ""The health and well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their families, and staff will continue to be our government's number one priority,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Ourgovernment is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure our loved ones in Ontario's long-term care homes are safe and secure."" To help maintain the health and safety of residents, staff and essential visitors, Ontario is also increasing long-term care bed availability to ensure homes are able to provide isolation rooms when required, as well as providing long-term beds for people on the long-term care waitlist. In particular, patients in the hospital who no longer require hospital services will benefit from this increased long-term care bed capacity, and their placement into long-term care will also free up hospital beds to treat acute patients. In addition, Ontario is making necessaryadjustments to ensure both resident and families' wishes are taken intoaccount, and a sufficient number of staff are available to support long-term care home residents. Updated procedures will bring further clarity around admitting, discharging, and readmitting long-term care home residents at a time when homes are trying their best to prevent thespread of COVID-19 among residents, staff and essential visitors. Lastly,the province is ensuring sufficient nursing and personal support care staff are available to support long-term care home residents. All new nurses and personal support workers hired to help long-term care homes cope with COVID-19 will be screened to ensure they are qualified and present no risk to long-term care home residents. These critical steps add to the protocols that have recently been implemented to ensurea safe and secure environment for residents. Long-term care homes continue to restrict non-essential visits and actively screen essential visitors, staff, students, volunteers, residents moving into along-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. Asof March 9, 2020, when long-term care homes submit samples for standardrespiratory testing, they are also being tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases.Quick FactsWhen utilized by long-term care homes, redeployment plans under the new order temporarily supersede the provisions of a collectiveagreement, including lay-off, seniority/service or bumping provisions.As part of the ongoing government effort to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 across the province, the government has provided initial emergency funding to the long-term care home sector of $50 million effective immediately.Additional ResourcesVisit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

This temporary order would give hospitalsthe ability to cancel and postpone services to free-up space and valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment plans.""On the best advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health,and in response to clear and urgent requests from our frontline health service providers, the province is taking decisive action to ensure we can continue to be responsive and nimble as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases grows,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While normal protocols are important in routine times, these extraordinary steps will ensure our health sector workers are there, where and when they are needed, to care for Ontarians and support our extensive effortsto contain this virus."" Under this temporary order hospitals will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as: Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the hospital;Redeploying staff to work in COVID-19 assessment centres;Changingthe assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferringor cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan.

As I said last week, these developments are the latest reminder that Ontario is part of an integrated global economy. As Premier Ford has made clear,our government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to protect the health of people and our economy in this province. Circumstanceshave changed rapidly in recent days. Markets around the world are volatile.  Employers and workers are feeling the economic impacts. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. During that time, I have been in frequent conversations with various experts, my fellow finance ministers, business and union leaders, and mycolleagues at Queen's Park. At the request of Premier Ford, I have convened a regular meeting of the ministers in our government who share economic responsibilities. The work of that committee includes reaching out on a daily basis to leaders at businesses big and small, including at our financial institutions, as well as unions, to ensure wehave the latest information, and that there is an open line of communication as the government works to address COVID-19's impact on the economy.  In response to events here at home and around the world, private-sector economists have revised the economic outlook used to develop the 2020 Ontario Budget scheduled to be released next Wednesday. AsOntario's Minister of Finance, it is important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given thedynamic situation. So instead of a full Budget, I will release an economic and fiscal update on March 25 based on our best understanding of the current situation. This update will include a realistic one-year outlook based on current economic projections. It will provide certainty to hospitals, schools, municipalities, and other partners for the year to come. Our approach will include increased resources for our healthcare system, direct support for people, and action to protect jobsand our economy. This is a responsible course that maintains confidenceand stability, while providing the flexibility to respond quickly to changing events. We will build on our record of transparency, with regular financial updates as the situation evolves.  We will ensurethe people of Ontario are informed by the most up-to-date information that is available. And as you all know, that information is changing rapidly. It will also allow for close collaboration with our partners, including the federal government, to protect Ontario's economy. Experience has shown this work is most effective when governments collaborate. This is exactly what I have proposed to the federal government. I was pleased to sit down with my colleague, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last week. Wehave stayed in close contact over the weekend and I'll be participatingin a call with all of the provincial finance ministers later today. Ourgovernment will make additional resources available to ensure Ontario'shealth-care system is able to respond to any scenario.  Our health-careprofessionals have our backs. They can be confident their government has theirs. Finally, I want to reiterate Premier Ford's commitment to support people throughout this crisis. From washing your hands to checking in on the most vulnerable among us, the people of Ontario are acting responsibly and doing their part during this global pandemic. Their government will do its part as well. Premier Ford and Minister McNaughton just spoke about some important measures in that regard. Ontario'shas strong economic fundamentals. We have more fiscal flexibility to respond to these sort of global events through actions we've taken over the previous 18 months. I'm confident that by acting decisively, and working together with our partners, Ontario is well positioned to weather the challenges ahead.""Additional ResourcesThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)"

""Ontario'spublic health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsivenessto COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to protect the health of all Ontarians."" Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, includingat William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codesfor telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessmentsover the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients athome rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is workingclosely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratorytesting is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers Toensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homesto ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year forthe province's public health units. This action ensures that historicalmunicipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keepmunicipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

Today, Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, announced that the government intends to introduce legislation that, if passed, would immediately provide job-protected leave to employees in isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to care for children because of school or day care closures.""While everyone's concerns about their health and safety is top of mind, the last thing we need is anyone worrying about job security asthe COVID-19 situation evolves,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why I directed the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development to draft legislation that will protect workers and their families during this difficult period."" ""Mothers and fathers who need to care forchildren or dependants shouldn't have to worry about losing their job,""said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""The same goes for people who receive medical or public health advice and are required to take precautions as a result. They shouldn't have to worry about losing their job. In this time of uncertainty, we need to support employees who must isolate or quarantinethemselves, or who need to care for a loved one."" The proposed legislation would, if passed, provide job protection for employees unable to work for the following reasons: · The employee is under medical investigation, supervision or treatment for COVID-19. · The employee is acting in accordance with an order under the Health Protection and Promotion Act. · The employee is in isolation or quarantine. · The employee is acting in accordance with public health information or direction. · The employer directs the employee not to work. · The employee needs to provide care to a person for a reason related to COVID-19 such as a school or day-care closure. Theproposed legislation would also make it clear that an employee will notbe required to provide a medical note if they take the leave. The measures would be retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. Many workers will be eligible for Employment Insurance sickness benefits. As well, we are reviewing current access and eligibility to emergency assistance which is available through the Ontario Works (OW) program to support individuals who are impacted by the coronavirus and who are not able to meet their basic living expenses. ""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health.

This is a critical step to help address the increased daily call volumes and reduce call wait times. ""By immediately expanding Telehealth's resources, we can significantly reduce the time it takes for Ontarians to receive the information they need to stay safeand healthy,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are also initiating further discussions with our nursing partners to ensure there are Telehealth resources in place moving forward as COVID-19 continues to evolve. We will be ready for any scenario."" Phase 1: Immediately Increase Resources to Reduce Call Wait Times Yesterday,the province and Ontario Health started to deploy approximately 130 nurses to conduct symptom assessments and referrals among callers who request a callback. Nurses will work from existing regional offices to provide immediate support and respond to callers seeking a callback to help mitigate current wait times. To onboard these additional nursing resources, Telehealth has developed a specific training package for newly added nurses to expedite their ability to provide callback support immediately. Telehealth will also increase intake staff to reduce wait times for initial contact with a Telehealth representative. Telehealthhas been providing valuable support to the Ministry's Emergency Operations Centre (MEOC) since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak inmid-January. In February, Telehealth began to add additional resources to manage increased daily call volumes, including seven full-time Registered Nurses and 10 customer service representatives. Phase 2: Continue to Manage COVID-19 Call Volumes Whileimplementation of Phase 1 is currently underway, Ontario and Telehealthhave already begun planning rollout of Phase 2. To further increase intake and nursing capacity over the coming days and weeks, Ontario is actively working with the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) to identify support for Telehealth from its 44,000 registered nurse members. The province has also started to explore existing non-clinical resources within the Ontario Public Service and other broader public sector organizations to support Telehealth's call volumes. In order to be prepared to be nimble and effective in any scenario, Ontario is also exploring a partnership with organizationswhich have existing health care call centres to provide symptom assessment for COVID-19 to callers requesting a callback. ""We understand that people are anxious to get the advice about next steps assoon as possible, which is why the capacity of Telehealth is being enhanced,"" says Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""But unless you are experiencing severe symptoms or a medical emergency, the best place for you to stay is at home until you receive advice, which will often be to stay home and self-monitor."" Inaddition to enhancing capacity at Telehealth, Ontario has approved new physician billing codes to enable doctors to continue to provide routinehealth care services by video and telephone, including assessment of possible COVID-19 symptoms. This will help keep patients at home rather than in their doctor's office where they would be in close contact with others. Ontario has also established dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in COVID-19 testing, with additional centres being established across the province in the coming weeks. Before visiting an assessment centre, individuals should first seek guidance on whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Ontarians can do so by using a new online self-assessment tool,calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or calling their local public health unit. People should not go to an assessment centre unless they have symptoms of the COVID-19. Quick FactsTelehealth Ontario is a free, confidential, provincial service that provides 24/7 access to health advice and information from aRegistered Nurse to all Ontarians in 300 languages. During this COVID-19 outbreak, Telehealth triages callers, provides information, assessment and depending on symptoms will inform patients on how to self-isolate.To date, there have been more than 8,000 COVID-19 related calls."

Ontario has also approved new physician billing codesfor telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessmentsover the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients athome rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is workingclosely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing.

The case is located in London, Ontario.Given the newness of the 2019 novel coronavirus and as part of the continuing cooperative efforts between Public Health Ontario (PHO) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Ontario has been sharing all test samples with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. As partof the National Microbiology Lab's efforts to ensure quality control, additional testing was performed on the samples provided. As a result ofthis additional testing, a case that was previously deemed negative by PHO's lab has now been found to be positive by the National MicrobiologyLab, which uses a more sensitive test that can identify the smallest trace presence of the virus. The majority of cases previously considerednegative have been confirmed as negative by the National Microbiology Lab. To provide the public with the greatest certainty, Ontario's reporting will now include a new category that more accuratelyreflects the province's status: presumptive negative. That said, for any person found presumptively negative by the PHO lab, there is an extremely low risk of transmitting the virus. The newly confirmedcase, a female in her 20s, arrived asymptomatic in Toronto on January 23, 2020 and was transported to London by way of a private vehicle. On January 24, 2020, the individual started to exhibit symptoms and that same day was assessed and tested at London Health Sciences Centre. She was released with follow up by the Middlesex-London Health Unit. This individual has had limited exposure to other individuals and has otherwise been in isolation since January 24, 2020, with regular contactby the Middlesex-London Health Unit to monitor her condition.

This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition: Workerswho have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available: A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Yourprimary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without firsthaving a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.  I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day inorder to protect your health. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstayat home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thankyou for all of your support.

If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available: A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Yourprimary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without firsthaving a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.  I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day inorder to protect your health. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstayat home if you are sick.

This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition: Workerswho have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options.

""Ontario'spublic health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsivenessto COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to protect the health of all Ontarians."" Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, includingat William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codesfor telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessmentsover the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients athome rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is workingclosely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratorytesting is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers Toensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homesto ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year forthe province's public health units. This action ensures that historicalmunicipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keepmunicipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

""What we determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 days,"" commissioner Adam Silver said while appearing on the NBA on TNT on Thursday. ""We don't know enough, as you've all said, to be more specific than that."" Nowthere will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positivewas centre Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmedthe presumptive positive test. A second person with knowledge told AP on Thursday that Gobert's Utah teammate, Donovan Mitchell, tested positive as well. The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed ""due to unforeseen circumstances.""

A second person who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid. The Utah Jazz hosted the Toronto Raptors in a 101-92 defeat on Monday.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, which declared a pandemic onWednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have beendiagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.

Earlier, the NCAA announced that the men's and women's Division I tournaments would be played without fans — exceptfor a few family members — permitted inside to watch. ""People are clearly taking the measures that they feel they need to take for safety,"" said Miami Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who played in both the Division I and Division III national championship games during his college days at Michigan and Williams. ""We love playing in frontof our fans and we feel like that gives us an advantage. But at the same time the NBA has to protect its players in the league and the fans,"" he said.

Jamie Strashin also provides an update from Blue Jays' spring training and how they've been impacted by the virus. 2:37 ""We would recommend that there not be large crowds,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, responding to a question about the NBA's reaction. ""Ifthat means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, sobe it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread."" At the time of the league's announcement, the Dallas Mavericks' home game against the Denver Nuggets was midway through the third quarter. Two other games — the New York Knicks at the Atlanta Hawks and the Charlotte Hornets at the Miami Heat — were late in the fourth quarter. All three games were allowed to finish before the suspension took effect. Thelast game of the night's six-game slate, New Orleans at Sacramento, wascalled off as well because one of the referees assigned to work that Pelicans-Kings game, Courtney Kirkland, worked the Jazz-Raptors game on Monday.

Ontario recently announced that the province is implementing an enhancedresponse structure to COVID-19 that brings together a wide range of partners to strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans. Thestructure involves the creation of a number of tables - or expert teams- including a new Command Table that will serve as a single point of oversight. Senior leadership from across government and the health sector are now providing clear strategic direction to guide Ontario's ongoing response to COVID-19. Through a Collaboration Table, stakeholders from the long-term care sector have the opportunity to provide valuable advice. Our government has also recently instructed long-term care homes to begin active screening of staff, students, volunteers, visitors, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. These individualswill now be proactively checked for symptoms and asked about recent travel history and contacts. Outbreaks can occur in long-term care homes throughout the year and, as it is flu season, homes currentlyhave respiratory infection outbreak protocols in place. When long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they will now also be tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases. Ontario continues to work directly with our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and local public health units to monitor the situation closely. Newly strengthened protocols for identification and control are in place to keep the public safe. These protocols and processes continue to be effective and the risk to Ontarians taking precautions to keep themselves and their families safe remains low. There are everyday actions that residents, staff and family members should continue to taketo reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;sneeze and cough into your sleeve;avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth;avoid contact with people who are sick;stay home if you are sick; anddo not visit a long-term care home if you are feeling ill. Ontario'scommitment to the safety, quality of care and quality of life of long-term care home residents is safeguarded by regulations and requirements in the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. Long-term care homes enforce rigorous provincial standards for all public health concerns, including outbreak management systems for detecting, managing,and controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care are working together in close cooperation with our partners in both the long-term care and other health care sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of residents, families and staff.""

Today, I joined Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health for Canada, and my ministerial colleagues from each of the provinces and territories to share important information and further coordinate our joint efforts to protect the health and well being of all Canadians, including Ontarians, from the emerging issues of the Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government outlined their enhanced measures, which now include: Screening questions at border kiosks will now include questions about previous travel to Wuhan, China in the past 14 days. A positive response would trigger an enhanced screening process, including sending the traveller to a Canadian border agent for further questioning about their health status. The border agent will determine whether the traveller needs to seek immediate medical assessment and treatment and, if so, EMS will transport the traveller from the airport directly to hospital. This screening will be done in Vancouver and Montreal as well.Fact sheets are also being developed in English, French and Chinese for people who have travelled to China and are not currently exhibiting signs of illness. These fact sheets will outline the symptoms that individuals should watch for and any next steps should they experience symptoms, including seeking an immediate medical assessment. The federalgovernment's enhanced screening measures build on Ontario's robust and comprehensive protocols in place to actively monitor for, detect and contain any suspected cases of Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government's measures will further support my ministry, in collaborationwith Public Health Ontario, local health units, hospitals and health care providers, to monitor the Wuhan novel coronavirus and contain any cases, should one present in Ontario. While the risk to Ontariansremains low, we will continue to be in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other jurisdictions to monitor this developing situation and safeguard the health of all Ontarians. I'dlike to thank all our partners for their on-going efforts in respondingto this emerging situation. I want to reiterate our top priority will always remain safeguarding the health of the public, patients and care providers."""
